## 🔍 GPT-4.1 Enhanced Capabilities

### 1. **Sophisticated Analytics**

**GPT-4** (Basic aggregations):
```python
total_donations = 4023.12
total_volunteer_hours = 287.0
```

**GPT-4.1** (Comprehensive analytics):
```python
# Basic metrics
total_donations = 4023.12
total_volunteering_hours = 287.0

# NEW: Advanced analytics
average_donation = 268.21
average_volunteering_hours = 19.13
average_campaigns_joined = 3.0
```

### 2. **Enhanced Structure Analysis**

**Benevity File Analysis Improvement:**
- **GPT-4**: Identified 4 basic metrics
- **GPT-4.1**: Identified 8 comprehensive metrics including:
  - Both totals AND averages for all numeric columns
  - Per-person calculations
  - More nuanced data interpretation

### 3. **Better Query Sophistication**

**GPT-4.1 generates more advanced queries:**
```python
# Supply Chain proportional analysis
proportion_sme_suppliers = 0.6
proportion_vcse_suppliers = 0.47
proportion_local_suppliers = 0.53

# HCM detailed breakdowns  
average_voluntary_hours_per_person = 12.27
average_training_hours_per_person = 17.53
average_absence_days_per_person = 9.13
```

### 4. **Improved Safety Detection**

GPT-4.1 shows enhanced safety awareness:
```
WARNING: Unsafe query skipped: df['Time to First Contact (days)'].dropna().mean()
WARNING: Unsafe query skipped: df['Certification Earned'].dropna().count()
```

This indicates the model is attempting more complex operations while the safety system appropriately filters risky queries.

## ⚠️ Challenges Still Present

### 1. **Same Data Type Issues**
```
ERROR: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
ERROR: could not convert string to float: 'unknown'
```
**Root Cause**: Mixed data types in source files (unchanged)

### 2. **New Query Complexity Issues**
```
ERROR: The truth value of a Series is ambiguous
```
**Root Cause**: GPT-4.1 generating pandas queries that are syntactically valid but logically ambiguous

### 3. **Verification Accuracy Trade-offs**
Some files show **reduced verification accuracy** despite more metrics:
- **Benevity**: 90.6% → 49.0% (more metrics, but some harder to verify)
- **HCM**: 90.2% → 44.1% (9 metrics vs 4, but verification is stricter)
